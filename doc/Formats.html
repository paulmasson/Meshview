1.2 File Formats</A>.</B></H1>

<P><B>Note: This document partially uses <A HREF="http://www.geom.umn.edu/software/geomview/ooglman.html">OOGL</A>
file format documentation distributed with <A HREF="http://www.geom.umn.edu/software/geomview/">Geomview</A>.
</B></P>

<P>The Meshview 1.2 supports <A HREF="#MESH">MESH</A>, <A HREF="#OFF">OFF</A>,
<A HREF="#LIST">LIST</A>, <A HREF="#FRAMES">FRAMES</A>, <A HREF="#DOT">DOT</A>,
and <A HREF="#LINE">LINE</A> formats. </P>

<P><A HREF="#MESH">MESH</A>, <A HREF="#OFF">OFF</A> and <A HREF="#LIST">LIST</A>
are very similar to the OOGL file formats. The OOGL formats are not fully
implemented (no support for files with more than 4 dimensions), but several
features are added. </P>

<P><A HREF="#FRAMES">FRAMES</A>, <A HREF="#DOT">DOT </A>and <A HREF="#LINE">LINE</A>
are specific to Meshview. <A HREF="#FRAMES">FRAMES</A> format is used for
key frame animation, <A HREF="#DOT">DOT</A> and <A HREF="#LINE">LINE</A>
are used to display dots and lines respectively. </P>

<P>Keywords are case sensitive. Some have optional prefix and suffix letters

<H3><A NAME="File Names"></A><A HREF="TOC.html#File Names.">File Names.</A></H3>

<P>Meshview uses the file suffix to guess the file type. If the suffix
is unrecognized, or if no suffix is available, all known types of objects
are tried in turn until one accepts the data as valid.</P>

<P>All data for a vertex is grouped together. </P>

<H4>The syntax is </H4>

<P>The conventional suffix for a MESH file is `.mesh'. `.3mesh', `.meshc',
and `.4mesh' are also supported. </P>

<H4>The file syntax is </H4>

<PRE>[U][C][C][N][Z][3][4][u][v][n]MESH[C][C] # key word 
[front.color] # color of the object (front side), present only if MESHC

vertex(0,Nv-1)      ...         vertex(Nu-1,Nv-1) </PRE>

<H4>The key word is [U][C][C][N][Z][3][4][u][v][n]MESH [C][C] </H4>

<H4>The optional prefix characters mean: </H4>

<UL>
<LI>`U' Each vertex includes a 3-component texture space parameter. The
first two components are the usual S and T texture parameters for that
vertex; the third should be specified as zero. </LI>

<LI>`C' Each vertex (see <A HREF="#vertices">Vertices</A> above) includes
a 4-component color (front side).</LI>

<LI>`C' Each vertex (see <A HREF="#vertices">Vertices</A> above) includes
a 4-component color (back side). </LI>

<LI>`N' Each vertex includes a surface normal vector. (Not used, see <A HREF="#Note">note</A><A HREF="#norm">
</A>above) </LI>

<LI>`Z' Of the 3 vertex position values, only the Z component is present;
X and Y are omitted, and assumed to equal the mesh (u,v) coordinate so
X ranges from 0 .. (Nu-1), Y from 0 .. (Nv-1) \ where Nu and Nv are the
mesh dimensions -- see below.</LI>

<LI>`3' Vertices are 3D, each consists of 3 floating values. 3 and 4 cannot
both be present. </LI>

<LI>`4' Vertices are 4D, each consists of 4 floating values. Z and 4 ,
and 3 and 4 cannot both be present. </LI>

<LI>`u' The mesh is wrapped in the u-direction, so the (0,v)-th vertex
is connected to the (Nu-1,v)'th for all v. </LI>

<LI>`v' The mesh is wrapped in the v-direction, so the (u,0)-th vertex
is connected to the (u,Nv-1)'th for all u. Thus a u-wrapped or v-wrapped
mesh is topologically a cylinder, while a uv-wrapped mesh is a torus. </LI>

<LI>`n' (<B>This format is unsupported in Meshview 1.2.)</B> Specifies
a mesh whose vertices live in a higher dimensional space. The dimension
follows the &quot;MESH&quot; keyword. Each vertex then has Ndim components.
</LI>
</UL>

<H4>The optional postfix characters mean:</H4>

<UL>
<LI>`C' object includes a 4-component color (front side). </LI>

<LI>`C' object includes a 4-component color (back side). </LI>
</UL>

<P>Note that the order of prefix characters is significant; a colored,
u-wrapped mesh is a CuMESH not a uCMESH.</P>

<P>Following the mesh header are RGBA colors of the object (if [C] postfix
are specified) and integers Nu and Nv, the dimensions of the mesh. </P>

<P>Then follow Nu*Nv vertices, each in the form given by the header. They
appear in v-major order, i.e. if we name each vertex by (u,v) then the
vertices appear in the order </P>

<P>Note that the order of prefix characters is significant. </P>

<P>OFF files (name for &quot;object file format&quot;) represent collections
of planar polygons with possibly shared vertices, a convenient way to describe
polyhedra. The polygons may be concave but there's no provision for polygons
containing holes. </P>

<P>An OFF file must begin with the keyword OFF. </P>

<P>Following the OFF header are RGBA colors of the object (if [C] postfixes
are specified) and three ASCII integers : NVertices, NFaces, and NEdges.
These are the number of vertices, faces, and edges, respectively. Meshview
does not use nor check NEdges; it needn't be correct but must be present.
</P>

<P>The vertex coordinates follow: (dimension * Nvertices) floating-point

either 3 (default) or 4 (specified by the key character 4 directly before
OFF in the keyword). </P>
