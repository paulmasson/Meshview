        You should already be able to login to any of our Macs. They are
configured to look to our ldap server for user authentication. So anyone
with a CS account can login.
        If you have a terminal window open, you can try this machine:
>ssh -l hanson gallows.cs.indiana.edu
        As for home directory, your regular (moose??? whale???) will be
mounted by default. However, be aware that OS X will create some
directories it needs in your home directory, such as Desktop, Documents,
Library, and some others. I just wanted you to be aware of this, so you
won't be wondering later, "Where the heck did those directoires come
from?!!?" OS X needs these directories, and creates them by default the
first time you login.
        There are developement tools installed, including compilers. You
can just use your regular home directory as noted above, or some
subdirectory you create on it. There will be nothing left on the local Mac
drive, unless you put it there on purpose. When you login, you should be
in your regular home directory.
